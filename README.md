Your appâ€™s name: Analog Society App 

There is a class of people who want a physical inventory of things just because or as a hedge against an evil digial empire. 

Either way, Analog Society is a great place to store and trade items like your whimsical Cat Tries to Catch Goldfish in a Bowl Puzzle.

Deployed app is at https://unit-2-project-analog-68891fefb380.herokuapp.com/

Project planning items are here https://trello.com/b/1XdXn3zM/ga-project-men-stack-crud-app

Technologies used: Node.JS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Express, MongoDB

Next Build: I want to create a sharing, trading and selling/buying function coupled with a sphere social element. I need to clean up the appearance of this app, make it simply irresistible and allow for more efficient links.

## Project Overview

**Analog Society** is inspired by the concept of a digital salvage yard set in a cyberpunk universe. Users can explore, add, modify, and manage a collection of retro tech items, all within an interface that reflects the gritty, neon-infused ambiance of a dystopian future.

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system to personalize user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various devices, ensuring a consistent experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
- **Dynamic Search**: Efficiently search and filter through the inventory to find specific items.
- **Interactive UI Elements**: Engage with glitch effects, animated components, and ambient sounds that enhance the immersive experience.

## Installation and Setup

To run **Analog Society** locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/robotwist/analog-society.git
   cd analog-society
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3045`.

## Design Elements

To fully immerse users in the futuristic salvage yard theme, **Analog Society** incorporates:

- **Glitch Effects**: Intentional visual distortions to emulate a hacked or corrupted interface.
- **Animated Components**: Dynamic elements like a junkbot sorting parts in the background.
- **Ambient Sounds**: Background audio featuring metallic clanks, radio static, and distant murmurs to enhance the atmosphere.
