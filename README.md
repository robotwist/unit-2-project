Your appâ€™s name: Analog Society App 

There is a class of people who want a physical inventory of things just because or as a hedge against an evil digial empire. 

Either way, Analog Society is a great place to store and trade items like your whimsical Cat Tries to Catch Goldfish in a Bowl Puzzle.

Deployed app is at https://unit-2-project-analog-68891fefb380.herokuapp.com/

Project planning items are here https://trello.com/b/1XdXn3zM/ga-project-men-stack-crud-app

Technologies used: Node.JS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Express, MongoDB

Next Build: I want to create a sharing, trading and selling/buying function coupled with a sphere social element. I need to clean up the appearance of this app, make it simply irresistible and allow for more efficient links.
