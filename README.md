Your app's name: Analog Society App 

**Analog Society** is a sophisticated platform for collectors, makers, and enthusiasts who value the tactile beauty and enduring quality of analog materials. In a world increasingly dominated by digital disposability, we celebrate the craftsmanship, durability, and inherent value of physical objects.

Our community documents, trades, rents, and sells analog materials while fostering critical discourse about technology, institutions, and the importance of preserving knowledge in physical form. We believe that the analog realm holds solutions to many of today's technological problems.

Deployed app is at https://unit-2-project-analog-68891fefb380.herokuapp.com/

Project planning items are here https://trello.com/b/1XdXn3zM/ga-project-men-stack-crud-app

Technologies used: Node.JS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Express, MongoDB

Next Build: Enhanced trading, renting, and selling functionality with photo documentation, local-first architecture for knowledge preservation, and a dedicated space for critical discourse on technology and institutions.
